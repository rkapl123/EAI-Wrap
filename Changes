	- added lookups to %config to allow for an additional merging of configs based on prefixes (especially for DB and FTP), added additionalParamsGet, additionalParamsPut, additionalParamsNew and additionalMoreArgs to EAI::FTP for more general usage of Net::SFTP::Foreign get, put and new. fixed error retry by adding $execute{retryBecauseOfError} to the condition of early returning from already successfullyDone subs. Reverted generalization of getKeyInfo to getSensInfo back as merging of lookups is now done generally. Added CONTRIBUTING text.

	- added $process->{hadErrors} = 1 to missing exception places in EAI::Wrap; added resetting of process{successfullyDone, filesProcessed and filenames}; simplified retrySeconds calculation; reduced extractArchives to only one archive per process (as this is checked before and needed for simplification); fixed endTime calculation; fixed filesToArchive; fixed suppressGetError for multiple Files in EAI::FTP::fetchFiles; added enforceConn and second hostkey to EAI::FTP::login; fixed environment setting of redoDir, logRootPath, historyFolder and historyFolderUpload; made selection of multiple entries determinate for explicitly enumerated lookups in config{checkLookup} (using reverse sort); checkLogExist.pl: added alreadyProcessedLogErrors check for avoiding multiple log check errors (including removal of yesterdays alreadyProcessedLogErrors check file and "successful for originally failed" message)
