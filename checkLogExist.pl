=head1 NAME

checkLogExist.pl - checks Log-entries at given times

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 checkLogExist.pl

=head1 DESCRIPTION

checkLogExist should be called frequently in a separate job and checks if defined log entries exist in the defined log files, (hinting that the task was run/started), resp. whether the Logfile exists at all.

Configuration is done in sub-hash C<$config{checkLookup}>, being the same place for the errmailaddress/errmailsubject of error mails being sent in the tasks themselves:

 $config{checkLookup} = {
  <nameOfJobscript.pl> => {
     errmailaddress => "test\@test.com",
     errmailsubject => "testjob failed",
     timeToCheck => "0800",
     freqToCheck => "B",
     logFileToCheck => "test.log",
     logcheck => "started.*",
     logRootPath => "optional alternate logfile path"
   },
  <...> => {
     
   },
 }

The key consists of the scriptname + any additional defined interactive options, which are being passed to the script in an alphabetically sorted manner. For checkLogExist.pl the key is irrelevant as all entries of C<$config{checkLookup}> are worked through.

=over 4

=item errmailaddress 

where should the mail sent to in case of non-existence or an error.

=item errmailsubject

subject-line for error mail, only used for error mail sending in the tasks itself.

=item timeToCheck

all checks earlier than this are ignored

=item freqToCheck

ignore log check except on: ML..Monthend, D..every day, B..Business days, M1..Month-beginning, W{n}..Weekday (n:1=Sunday-7=Saturday)

=item logFileToCheck

Where (which logfile) should the job have written into ? this logfile is expected either in the logRootPath configured in site.config or in logRootPath configured for this locgceck entry (see below).

=item logcheck

"regex keyword/expression" to compare the rows, if this is missing in the logfile after the current date/timeToCheck then an alarm is sent to the configured errmailaddress

=item logRootPath

instead of using the logRootPath configured in site.config, a special logRootPath can be optionally configured here for each log check.
